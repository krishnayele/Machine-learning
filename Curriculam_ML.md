# Curriculum for Machine Learning

> ##  Month 1 course 
  
## Each column should be spent 2-3 hours deep learning



|Maths         |Machine Learning |
|--------------|-------------|
|Linear Algebra  | learn python for Data science|
|| The math of Intelligence
|| Intro to tensorflow
|calculus | INtro to ML Udacity
| probabilty & statistic | ML Projects|
|Algorithm & complexity | ML projects|
---

> Note : Choose 1 small project end of the each week to implement what you learned that week.
However it is recommended to take up 2 Projects
